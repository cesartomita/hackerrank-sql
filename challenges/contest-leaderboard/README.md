# Contest Leaderboard

You did such a great job helping Julia with her last coding contest challenge that she wants you to work on this one, too!

The total score of a hacker is the sum of their maximum scores for all of the challenges. Write a query to print the **hacker_id**, **name**, and total score of the hackers ordered by the descending score. If more than one hacker achieved the same total score, then sort the result by ascending **hacker_id**. Exclude all hackers with a total score of `0` from your result.

## Input Format

The following tables contain contest data:

**Hackers**: The **hacker_id** is the id of the hacker, and **name** is the name of the hacker.

**Submissions**: The **submission_id** is the id of the submission, **hacker_id** is the id of the hacker who made the submission, **challenge_id** is the id of the challenge for which the submission belongs to, and **score** is the score of the submission.

**Submissions** Table:

## Sample Output

```text
4071 Rose 191
74842 Lisa 174
84072 Bonnie 100
4806 Angela 89
26071 Frank 85
80305 Kimberly 67
49438 Patrick 43
```

## Explanation

Hacker `4071` submitted solutions for challenges `19797` and `49593`, so the total score `= 95 + max(43, 96) = 191`.

Hacker `74842` submitted solutions for challenges `19797` and `63132`, so the total score `= max(98, 5) + 76 = 174`.

Hacker `84072` submitted solutions for challenges `49593` and `63132`, so the total score `= 100 + 0 = 100`.

The total scores for hackers `4806`, `26071`, `80305`, and `49438` can be similarly calculated.
